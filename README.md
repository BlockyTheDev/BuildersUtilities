# BuildersUtilities
A fork of Arcaniax's BuildersUtilities with customizable messages and
nicer-looking GUIs.

## What's different?

- Every message is easily configurable.
- Both the permissions and the commands have been completely redone. (See the
  [plugin.yml][links] for an updated list!)
- All the GUIs have been revamped. Everything looks and feels a lot nicer.

In addition to that, everything has been polished and reviewed, rigorously, by
me, over a couple sleepless nights. Now *that's* what I call quality code.
