# BuildersUtilities
A curated bundle of tiny features that help builders do their thing.

This is a fork of [Arcaniax's BuildersUtilities][arcaniax-bu] with customizable
messages and nicer-looking GUIs.

## What's different?

- Every message is easily configurable.
- Both the permissions and the commands have been completely redone. (See the
  [plugin.yml][plugin.yml] for an updated list!)
- All the GUIs have been revamped. Everything looks and feels a lot nicer.

In addition to that, everything has been polished and reviewed, rigorously, by
me, over a couple sleepless nights. Now *that's* what I call quality code.
